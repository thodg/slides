# Language

## Structure

### Three components

Any formal language usable with a model is composed of three things :

 - A schema (or grammar)
 - Semantics
 - Data

### Schema

In model theory a schema allows you to define an ontology,
that is a definition of what can and cannot be expressed in your
language.

It is the shape of your language, the rules which make any pattern
part of the language or not.

The most used schemas for formal language definition are grammars.

The schema is a generalistic view of all the data that can be
expressed in the language.

It can be a relative process where parts of the structure of the
language are combined to form a more complex schema, e.g. a
grammar made of simpler rules.

### Semantics

Semantics tell you the meaning of the language. They describe
how to translate your language into another one.

This is a relative process : a semantic is from a language to another,
even if it is the same language acting as source and destination
language.

Semantics give meaning to your language which otherwise is just another
data model.

A number of programming languages also export the semantics of
lower-level constructs such as mathematical operations from the processor
or disk access from the kernel.

Semantics tells you how your language relates to other languages.
It is a connection to other languages.

### Data

Data is valid use of the language for reasons pertaining to its
semantics.

It is a direct application of the language schema.

The data of the language is directed by the semantics of
the language.

Usually the schema of the language has an entropy of orders
of magnitude higher than the available storage space for the
language data.

Data is a choice from the possibilities of the language schema
driven by the semantics of the language.

It is the most precise use of the language. Each datum represents
a single valid use of the language and can be uniquely identified.
